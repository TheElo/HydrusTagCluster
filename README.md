## V0.1


Known Limitations:
- Images do not scale correctly
- Aspect ratio has to be set manually
- Mouse Hovering over images causeses issues
- performance gets very low with lots of clusters
- currently used hard saved tags instead of displayed


# Future Ideas

- cluster limit, example: show only top 20 clusters
- sub clusters
- sorting scheme key use for hierarchical clustering
